Im struggling with the assignment\n\nIn the appropriate email example, you have inserted images of your errors and sometimes issues can be resolved through email without even having to meet. If the issue can not be easily resolved through email I now have your schedule and can easily setup an appointment to meet.\nIn the not appropriate email email example, I reply yes then give you my available times, afterwards you reply you can’t meet during those times so you send me your available times, and then I proceed to agree with those times etc… This long and tedious process can be avoided from the start if you just follow the first example :)"
