## Confidence Interval for a Proportion 

Things to write about:

1. How to sample rows from a dataset
2. Overview of confidence intervals
3. Formulas for constructing $(1-\alpha)\%$ CI and give examples for $90, 95,99\%$ CI  
4. Demonstrate simulation based approach for CI, what does it really mean to be  $(1-\alpha)\%$ confident 
5. Conclude with simple `prop.test()`

## Questions

1e) generate CI for our sample proportion using the sample results (One Signle CI from on sample)

1g) population proportion
