In this lab you will:

1. Learn how to conduct confidence interval for one population proportion
2. Learn how to conduct hypothesis tests for one population proportion


The corresponding tutorials are listed below

- [Confidence Intervals](/ucla/stats10/confidence_intervals.qmd)
- [Hypothesis Testing](/ucla/stats10/hypothesis_testing.qmd)


There is a lot of background material to cover in these tutorials which I am glossing over. For further details on confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for a proportion refer to notes from class.

As a supplement here are some of my notes from a previous course I've thought <\br>
[[Foundations of Inference]](/docs/notes/Inference-Foundations.pdf "PDF")
