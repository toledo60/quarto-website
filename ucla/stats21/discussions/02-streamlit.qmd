## Setting up your project

We will use VScode throughout this tutorial. First create a folder with an appropriate name, in your desired destination. I will create a folder called `simple_app` in my `Desktop` directory


## Installing Streamlit

You can follow the official [installation guide](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation) if you prefer using virtual environments

This guide assumes global installation

On Windows use `pip` and on macOS use `pip3`

```{python}
#| eval: false
pip install streamlit
```

<details>
<summary>Location of Packages</summary>
If you want to know where your packages are installed run the command 

```{python}
#| eval: false
pip show PACKAGE_NAME | grep Location
```

For example, 

```{python}
pip show numpy | grep Location
```

</details>

## Requirements

You will need a `requirements.txt` file in your project to let streamlit know which packages were used *(this is where a virtual environment is useful)*. We used `numpy`, `pandas`, `streamlit`, `matplotlib`, to check the version used for each of these packages run the following command 

```{python}
#| eval: false
pip show PACKAGE_NAME | grep Version
```

For example,

```{python}
pip show numpy | grep Version
```


So in our `requirements.txt` file we will add the entry

> numpy >= 1.21.5

We repeat the process for all of the packages used in our streamlit application
