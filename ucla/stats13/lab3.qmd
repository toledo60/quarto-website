In this lab you will:

- Reinforce understanding of simulating and random sampling
- Be introduced to Central Limit Theorem and its applications


For a review of sampling and simulation refer back to the following tutorial from [Lab 2](/ucla/stats13/labs/lab2.qmd)

-  [Introduction to Sampling and Simulation](/ucla/stats10/sampling_simulation.qmd)

Otherwise, you can proceed to these tutorials in the following order

1. [Normal Distribution](/ucla/stats10/normal_distribution.qmd)
2. [Central Limit Theorem](/ucla/stats10/CLT.qmd)
