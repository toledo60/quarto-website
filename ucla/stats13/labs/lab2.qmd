In this lab we will learn about logical statements and their applications such as subsetting. Basics of control-flow by introducing for-loops and using them for performing  simulations. Read the following tutorials in the following order:

1. [Logical Statements and Applications](/ucla/stats10/labs/lab2.qmd)
2. [For-Loops](/ucla/stats13/for-loops.qmd)
3. [Introduction to Sampling and Simulation](/ucla/stats10/sampling_simulation.qmd)
4. [Null Distribution of Sample Proportions](/ucla/stats13/null_proportion.qmd)
