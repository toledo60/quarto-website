::: {.column-page}
I am currently a fifth year Statistics Ph.D. student at University of California, Los Angeles *(UCLA)* working with [Hongquan Xu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~hqxu/). Prior to joining UCLA, I obtained my BA and MS degrees in Statistics from California State University, Fullerton. You can learn more about me from my [CV](/docs/CV/CV.pdf "CV")


I am gratefully funded by the [Eugene V. Cota-Robles Fellowship](https://grad.ucla.edu/funding/financial-aid/funding-for-entering-students/eugene-v-cota-robles-fellowship/)
