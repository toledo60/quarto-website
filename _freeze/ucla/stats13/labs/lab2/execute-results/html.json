Basics of control-flow by introducing for-loops and using them for performing  simulations. Read the following tutorials in the following order:\n\n1. [Logical Statements and Applications](/ucla/stats10/labs/lab2.qmd)\n2. [For-Loops](/ucla/stats13/for-loops.qmd)\n3. [Introduction to Sampling and Simulation](/ucla/stats10/sampling_simulation.qmd)\n4. [Null Distribution of Sample Proportions](/ucla/stats13/null_proportion.qmd)\n\n\n",
