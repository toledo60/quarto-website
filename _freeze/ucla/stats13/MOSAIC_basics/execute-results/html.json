Make sure to load `mosiac` package first, you only have to do this once at the beginning of your script. Proceeding, this tutorial will assume you have loaded the `mosaic` package\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .styled-output}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show Messages\"}\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\n#> Registered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n#>   method                           from   \n#>   fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n#> \n#> The 'mosaic' package masks several functions from core packages in order to add \n#> additional features.  The original behavior of these functions should not be affected by this.\n#> \n#> Attaching package: 'mosaic'\n#> The following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n#> \n#>     count, do, tally\n#> The following object is masked from 'package:Matrix':\n#> \n#>     mean\n#> The following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n#> \n#>     stat\n#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n#> \n#>     binom.test, cor, cor.test, cov, fivenum, IQR, median, prop.test,\n#>     quantile, sd, t.test, var\n#>     \n#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n#> \n#>     max, mean, min, prod, range, sample, sum\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe above output are simply messages when initially starting up the package warning you about masking of functions with the same name as different packages\n\n\nFor example, the function `binom.test()` is used in two different packages `mosaic` and `stats`. If two packages use the same function name, then the package loaded last will hide the function from earlier packages. This is called **masking**. \n\nWhile in general, the order of packages being loaded does not matter, if you are using multiple packages which have functions with the exact same name it is better to explicitly call the function name using `package_name::function`\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmosaic::binom.test()\nstats::binom.test()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Basics\n\n\n\nFor **numerical summaries**, the following functions are `mosaic` specific\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mosaic) \ntally() \nfavstats()\ndiffmean()\nprop()       \nperc()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWhile the following functions are in `base R`, `MOSAIC` provides equivalent functions with a `formula interface`. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmosaic::mean()\nmosaic::median()\nmosaic::sd()\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you are going to use say the function `mean` make sure to specify it is the `mosaic` version. For example, `mosaic::mean()`. If you want to know the differences between `base R` version \\newline \nrun `?base::mean()` or `?mosaic::mean()`\n\n\n\n\n**Randomization/Simulation**\n\nFor randomization or simulations procedures we will primarily use the following `mosaic` functions\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrflip()\ndo() \n```\n:::\n\n\n\nFor a quick overview of the basic of MOSAIC package, refer to [Minimal R for Intro Stats](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic/vignettes/MinimalRgg.pdf) tutorial. Note, we will not use all of the functions in the `mosaic` package\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
