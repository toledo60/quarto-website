The original behavior of these functions should not be affected by this.\n#> \n#> Attaching package: 'mosaic'\n#> The following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':\n#> \n#>     count, do, tally\n#> The following object is masked from 'package:Matrix':\n#> \n#>     mean\n#> The following object is masked from 'package:ggplot2':\n#> \n#>     stat\n#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n#> \n#>     binom.test, cor, cor.test, cov, fivenum, IQR, median, prop.test,\n#>     quantile, sd, t.test, var\n#>     \n#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n#> \n#>     max, mean, min, prod, range, sample, sum\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe above output are simply messages when initially starting up the package warning you about masking of functions with the same name as different packages\n\n\nFor example, the function `binom.test()` is used in two different packages `mosaic` and `stats`. If two packages use the same function name, then the package loaded last will hide the function from earlier packages. This is called **masking**. \n\nWhile in general, the order of packages being loaded does not matter, if you are using multiple packages which have functions with the exact same name it is better to explicitly call the function name using `package_name::function`\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmosaic::binom.test()\nstats::binom.test()\n```\n:::\n",
