A simple template to follow is\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nread.csv(file = 'path where csv is located at in your computer')\n```\n:::\n\n\nAn easy way to find the location of your data *(or any file)* is using the `file.choose()` function in R. `file.choose()` will bring up a file explorer window that allows you to interactively choose a file path to work with.\n\nIn your console, run the following command\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfile.choose()\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor example, after running the above command the `births` dataset is located in\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"/Users/toledo60/Desktop/Projects/personal-website/ucla/stats10/data/births.csv\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::callout-warning\nDepending on your location and operating system the directory will be different\n:::\n\nTherefore, to read the `births` data set I would copy/paste the directory of the csv location and run the following command\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbirth_dat <- read.csv(file = \"/Users/toledo60/Desktop/Projects/personal-website/ucla/stats10/data/births.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Gender Premie weight Apgar1 Fage Mage Feduc Meduc TotPreg Visits   Marital\n1   Male     No    124      8   31   25    13    14       1     13   Married\n2 Female     No    177      8   36   26     9    12       2     11 Unmarried\n3   Male     No    107      3   30   16    12     8       2     10 Unmarried\n4 Female     No    144      6   33   37    12    14       2     12 Unmarried\n5   Male     No    117      9   36   33    10    16       2     19   Married\n6 Female     No     98      4   31   29    14    16       3     20   Married\n  Racemom Racedad Hispmom Hispdad Gained     Habit MomPriorCond BirthDef\n1   White   White NotHisp NotHisp     40 NonSmoker         None     None\n2   White   White Mexican Mexican     20 NonSmoker         None     None\n3   White Unknown Mexican Unknown     70 NonSmoker At Least One     None\n4   White   White NotHisp NotHisp     50 NonSmoker         None     None\n5   White   Black NotHisp NotHisp     40 NonSmoker At Least One     None\n6   White   White NotHisp NotHisp     21 NonSmoker         None     None\n     DelivComp BirthComp\n1 At Least One      None\n2 At Least One      None\n3 At Least One      None\n4 At Least One      None\n5         None      None\n6         None      None\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::callout-warning\nThe above tutorial assumes the data set is a `csv` file in working condition. That is we assume the default settings for `read.csv`. In some cases we may need to change the header, specify the field separator and more. See `?read.csv` for further details and examples.\n:::\n\nWe are not just limited to `csv` files, we can import data from Excel (in `csv`, `XLSX`, or `txt` format), `SAS`, `Stata`, `SPSS`, or others.
