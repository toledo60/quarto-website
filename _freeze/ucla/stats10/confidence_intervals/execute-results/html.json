Factory workers have improperly disposed of arsenic and sulfur waste from the candy-making process, and the contamination has reached the local water supply! We have data for arsenic and sulfur levels from the water in all houses within a 2-mile radius of the factory\n\n\nSome important variables include:\n\n* `Arsenic`: arsenic levels for each home in ppm\n* `Sulfur`: sulfur levels for each home in ppm\n* `New_hlth_issue`: Indicates `Y` is someone living at the home has experienced a major health issue after the date of contamination, `N` if no new health complications\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(pawnee)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#>   ID Latitude Longitude Arsenic Sulfur New_hlth_issue\n#> 1  1 41.09414 -85.60974       0      0              N\n#> 2  2 41.09054 -85.70344       0    130              N\n#> 3  3 41.08601 -85.71996       4    170              N\n#> 4  4 41.08100 -85.75415       0      0              Y\n#> 5  5 41.07435 -85.70043       0      0              N\n#> 6  6 41.07399 -85.71788       0      0              N\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
